Clonaria
========

Clonaria is an open source clone of the video game Terraria (http://terraria.org/) written in Java that is intended to serve as a fun programming exercise.  This is not meant to be "good" code; while cleaniness and flexibility are secondary goals, the primary focus is on learning and exploring, and much of the code is the result of little but trial and error.
